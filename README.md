**Overview**

This repository contains a collection of R scripts focused on various statistical methods, data visualization, and data manipulation techniques. The scripts cover a wide range of topics, including ANOVA tests, regression analysis, boxplots, reshaping data, and more. This repository serves as a practical resource for R learners and those working with statistical analysis and data visualization.

**Files Included:**

- ANOVA + Wilcoxon + Correlation + Regression: This script demonstrates how to perform ANOVA, Wilcoxon tests, correlation analysis, and regression analysis using sample datasets.
- ANOVA One-Way: A script for performing a one-way ANOVA test, used for comparing the means of more than two groups.
- ANOVA Two-Way: A script for performing a two-way ANOVA test, useful for examining the interaction between two independent variables.
- Boxplot Scaling: A script to visualize data distributions using boxplots and how to scale them for better visualization.
- Fundamental: Basic R programming concepts including variables, functions, and control structures.
- One-Sample T-Test: A script demonstrating how to perform a one-sample t-test to compare the sample mean against a known value.
- Plotting: Various plotting techniques in R to visualize data effectively (scatter plots, bar charts, etc.).
- Reshaping: Techniques to reshape data in R, including functions like melt() and dcast() for data transformation.
- Simulation and Test: A script that demonstrates how to perform simulations in R and test the results statistically.

**Key Features**

1. ANOVA + Wilcoxon + Correlation + Regression

    This script demonstrates how to perform:

      - ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Used to test the differences between two or more groups.
      - Wilcoxon Test: A non-parametric test to compare two paired samples.
      - Correlation: To evaluate the relationship between two variables.
      - Regression: Both linear and multiple regression to predict outcomes based on predictor variables.

2. ANOVA One-Way

    The One-Way ANOVA test compares the means of three or more independent groups. The script uses sample data and performs the statistical test to determine if there are significant differences between group means.

3. ANOVA Two-Way

    This script demonstrates the Two-Way ANOVA test, which looks at the impact of two independent variables on a dependent variable, and helps assess if there is an interaction effect between them.

4. Boxplot Scaling

    Visualize data distributions using boxplots. This script also includes methods to scale and customize boxplots for better clarity and comparison.

5. Fundamental R Concepts

    This script covers basic R programming concepts such as data types, variables, loops, functions, and conditional statements to help beginners understand how to program in R.

6. One-Sample T-Test

    The One-Sample T-Test compares the mean of a single sample against a known population mean to determine if there is a significant difference.

7. Plotting

    This script covers various plotting techniques using Râ€™s visualization libraries (such as ggplot2) to create insightful visualizations, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and histograms.

8. Reshaping Data

    This script demonstrates how to reshape data, including how to use functions such as melt() and dcast() to convert data into the desired format for analysis.

9. Simulation and Test

    The Simulation and Test script provides methods to perform Monte Carlo simulations, test the resulting datasets, and analyze the outcomes using statistical methods.
